#+title: Coding Challenges

Idea from [[https://github.com/CodingChallengesFYI/SharedSolutions][this repo]] but just my versions so that I can do it in haskell without worrying about it being horribly written. I've removed some of them because I'm not interested and others (like Discord bots) I've already done. These are just the ones that I want to do.
